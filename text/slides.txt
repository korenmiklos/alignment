= Four facts =
== 1. Global exposure differs across firms, even conditional on size ==
1. Export shares vary widely, mostly independently of size. (next slide, Kee and Krishna 2008)
2. Size is a minor determinant of becoming an exporter. (Armenter and Koren 2015: pseudo-$R^2=0.05$)
3. Size is a minor determinant of importing intermediate inputs. (Halpern, Koren and Szeidl 2015)

== 2. Measures of global exposure are correlated ==
1. Firms with ''anything'' foreign are more likely to export (next slide)
2. Foreign ''owned'' firms import more intermediate inputs (Halpern, Koren and Szeidl 2015) and machines (Halpern, Hornok, Koren and Szeidl 2019)
3. Exports and capital imports increase after foreign ''manager'' takes over firm (Koren and Telegdy 2019)

== 3. Firms in new markets grow slowly ==

== 4. Managers earn high wages, especially at large firms ==

= Model =
== Key ingredients ==
1. Diminishing returns 
2. Complementarity
3. Matching 
= Cross sectional predictions =
== Cross sectional predictions ==
Use jointly normal?

= Comparative statics =
= Measurement =
== Identification ==
1. Supply shocks
2. Many dimensions
3.   Instrument export returns by domestic demand shocks
